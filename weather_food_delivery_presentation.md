# Weather and Food Delivery
## Slide 1: Title
**Weather and Food Delivery: How the Skies Affect Our Meals**

---

## Slide 2: Introduction to the Topic
- Food delivery is a part of everyday life.
- Weather can impact how quickly your meal arrives.
- We explore the connection between weather and food delivery.

---

## Slide 3: Goals of the Research
- Predict how weather conditions affect food delivery.
- Identify which weather factors cause delays or change order volume.
- Help companies, restaurants, and customers plan better.

---

## Slide 4: Data Overview
- Combined food delivery records and local weather data.
- Delivery records: order times, durations.
- Weather data: temperature, rainfall, wind speed.
- Matched each delivery with weather at that time.

---

## Slide 4a: Data Collection Process
- Collected food delivery records from local delivery platforms.
- Gathered weather data from official meteorological sources.
- Matched each delivery with weather conditions at the time and location of the order.
- Ensured privacy and data quality throughout the process.

---

## Slide 5: Clustering Results – Finding Patterns
- Used KMeans and DBSCAN to group similar deliveries.
- Cluster plots show groups based on weather and timing.
- Dendrogram reveals how groups merge.
- Certain weather conditions lead to more delays.

---

## Slide 6: Predictive Models – How Well Can We Predict Delays?
- Tested several models to predict delivery delays.
- Decision Tree & AdaBoost: ~94% accuracy.
- Models balance accuracy and catching real delays.
- Companies can use these to plan ahead.

---

## Slide 7: Key Findings and Practical Impact
- Heavy rain/snow: delivery times increase 20-30%.
- Fewer orders in extreme heat/cold.
- Busiest times: mild-weather weekends.
- Rainfall & wind speed: biggest predictors of delays.
- Companies/restaurants can plan staffing and inventory.

---

## Slide 8: Conclusions – What Does This Mean for You?
- Weather impacts food delivery for everyone.
- Companies can reduce delays.
- Restaurants manage staff/inventory better.
- Customers set realistic expectations.
- Combining weather and delivery data makes the process smarter and more reliable.
