# Weather Impact on Food Delivery Analysis

## Project Overview
Have you ever wondered why some days your favorite restaurants are busier with deliveries than others? Or why certain types of food become more popular during specific weather conditions? This project dives into these fascinating questions by exploring how weather affects our food delivery habits.

## What We're Exploring
We're looking at how different weather conditions - from sunny days to rainy evenings - influence what food people order and how often they use delivery services. Think about it: on a cold, rainy day, you might be more likely to order in, while a beautiful sunny day might inspire you to venture out to a restaurant.

## Key Questions We're Answering
- How does temperature affect food delivery patterns?
- Do rainy days lead to more food deliveries?
- Are certain types of cuisine more popular in specific weather conditions?
- How do different cities respond to weather changes in terms of food delivery?

## Why This Matters
Understanding these patterns helps:
- Restaurants better prepare for busy delivery times
- Delivery services improve their efficiency
- Customers know when to expect longer or shorter delivery times
- Business owners make smarter decisions about staffing and inventory

## What We Found
Our analysis revealed some interesting patterns:
- Weather significantly impacts delivery service usage
- Different cities show unique delivery patterns based on their weather
- Certain cuisines are more popular during specific weather conditions
- Temperature and precipitation play key roles in delivery decisions

## Tools & Visualizations
We've created easy-to-understand visualizations that show:
- Temperature effects on delivery patterns
- Rainfall impact on ordering habits
- Popular cuisines during different weather conditions
- City-specific delivery trends

This project combines real-world weather data with food delivery information to tell the story of how weather shapes our food ordering habits. Whether you're a restaurant owner, delivery service provider, or just someone interested in food delivery patterns, our findings offer valuable insights into this fascinating relationship between weather and food delivery behavior.
