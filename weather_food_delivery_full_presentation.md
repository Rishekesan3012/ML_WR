# Weather and Food Delivery: Full Analysis Presentation

---

## Slide 1: Title
**Weather and Food Delivery: How Weather Impacts Your Meal**

---

## Slide 2: Introduction
- Food delivery is a daily convenience for many.
- Weather can significantly affect delivery times and order patterns.
- This presentation explores how weather shapes the food delivery experience.

---

## Slide 3: Research Goals
- Predict how weather conditions impact food delivery.
- Identify which weather factors cause delays or change order volume.
- Help companies, restaurants, and customers plan better.

---

## Slide 4: Data Overview
- Combined food delivery records and weather data.
- Delivery records: order times, durations, locations.
- Weather: temperature, rainfall, humidity, wind speed.
- Each delivery matched with weather at that time and place.

---

## Slide 5: Data Collection Process
- Delivery data from major platforms.
- Weather data from Open-Meteo and National Weather Service.
- Focused on five major U.S. cities for diversity.
- Used multiple sources and techniques to ensure accuracy.

---

## Slide 6: What the Data Looks Like
- Thousands of delivery records, each linked to weather conditions.
- Patterns: more orders on weekends, longer delivery times during storms.
- [Insert sample charts: cuisine distribution, temperature, delivery map.]

---

## Slide 7: Cuisine and Geospatial Patterns
- Top cuisines: [show bar chart].
- Delivery hotspots: [show city map].
- Some neighborhoods and cuisines have unique delivery patterns.

---

## Slide 8: Weather Patterns in the Data
- Temperature, humidity, wind speed distributions.
- [Show boxplots or histograms for each.]
- Data covers a wide range of weather scenarios.

---

## Slide 9: Clustering Analysis – KMeans
- KMeans groups deliveries by similarity.
- Found clusters of quick deliveries and clusters of delays (often during bad weather).
- [Show KMeans cluster plot.]
- Inference: Weather and timing are key to delivery speed.

---

## Slide 10: Clustering Analysis – DBSCAN
- DBSCAN finds tightly grouped deliveries and outliers.
- Outlier deliveries usually happen during extreme weather or in unusual locations.
- [Show DBSCAN cluster plot.]
- Inference: Extreme weather creates exceptions—focus on these to improve reliability.

---

## Slide 11: Clustering Analysis – Hierarchical
- Builds a “family tree” of deliveries.
- Similar neighborhoods and weather conditions merge early in the tree.
- [Show dendrogram.]
- Inference: Geography and weather shape delivery patterns.

---

## Slide 12: Predictive Modeling Overview
- Goal: Predict delivery delays based on data.
- Tested models: Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, AdaBoost.
- [Show table of model performance.]

---

## Slide 13: Model Results – Decision Tree & AdaBoost
- Decision Tree & AdaBoost: ~94% accuracy.
- Most important predictors: rainfall and wind speed.
- Inference: Weather forecasts can help prevent delays.

---

## Slide 14: Model Results – Other Algorithms
- Naive Bayes and Logistic Regression also performed well.
- Slightly less accurate than Decision Tree/AdaBoost.
- All models show weather is a key factor.

---

## Slide 15: Key Visual Insights
- More orders on weekends and mild weather.
- Delivery times spike during storms.
- Certain cuisines and neighborhoods have unique patterns.
- [Show relevant visualizations.]

---

## Slide 16: Practical Impact
- Companies: Add drivers or adjust routes during bad weather.
- Restaurants: Prepare for busy/slow periods based on forecasts.
- Customers: Set realistic expectations for delivery times.

---

## Slide 17: Conclusions
- Weather clearly impacts food delivery for everyone.
- Data and models help reduce delays and improve planning.
- Combining weather and delivery data makes the process smarter and more reliable.

---

## Slide 18: Future Improvements
- Add more cities and real-time data.
- Use more advanced models and features.
- Study economic impacts and expand analysis.
